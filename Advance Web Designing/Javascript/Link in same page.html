Q.3. Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions given below. (10)

At least one earthquake happens somewhere in the world every day. On some days
there are many more. A few cause great damage and loss of life: some are felt only as
slight shudders of the ground: many more are so small that they cannot be felt at all.
We know about them only because they are shown on a seismograph – a delicate
instrument which records movement of the ground. It has a small needle which
scratches a white line on a strip of black paper, which is going round on a drum. When
everything is quite still the line is straight, but when the ground shakes the line become
wiggly. A severe earthquake, even though it is a long way away, makes large wiggles
on the line.
Many earthquakes happen under the sea and they often cause great waves, called
tsunamis. Tsunamis are taller than a house and they race across the sea one after
another at high speed. Ships in their path may be wrecked and, when the waves reach
land, there may be flooding and enormous damage.
